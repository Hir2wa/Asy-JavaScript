Feature Callbacks Promises
💡 Concept A function passed as an argument to another function An object representing the eventual result of an async operation
🔄 Chaining Messy (callback hell 😵) Clean and readable .then() chaining
🧠 Error Handling Must handle errors manually in each callback Built-in .catch() makes error handling easy
🌐 Use Case Older way, still used in some libraries Modern, more powerful and easier to read
📟 Looks like doSomething(callback) doSomething().then().catch()
